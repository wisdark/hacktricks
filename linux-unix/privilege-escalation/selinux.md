# SELinux

## SELinux Users

There are SELinux users in addition to the regular Linux users. SELinux users are part of an SELinux policy. Each Linux user is mapped to a SELinux user as part of the policy. This allows Linux users to inherit the restrictions and security rules and mechanisms placed on SELinux users.
