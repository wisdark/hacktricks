# Harvesting tickets from Windows

In Windows, tickets are **handled and stored by the lsass** (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process, which is responsible for security. Hence, to retrieve tickets from a Windows system, it is necessary to **communicate with lsass and ask for them**. As a **non-administrative user only owned tickets can be fetched**, however, as machine **administrator**, **all** of them can be harvested. For this purpose, the tools **Mimikatz or Rubeus** can be used as shown below:

```
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export
.\Rubeus dump
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("ticket.kirbi", [Convert]::FromBase64String("<BASE64_TICKET>"))
```
