# MSI Wrapper

Download the free version app from [https://www.exemsi.com/documentation/getting-started/](https://www.exemsi.com/download/), execute it and wrap the "malicious" binary on it.  
Note that you can wrap a "**.bat**" if you **just** want to **execute** **command lines \(instead of cmd.exe select the .bat file\)**

\(Please, note that if you try to pack your own binary you will be able to modify these values\)

From here just click on **next buttons** and the last **build button and your installer/wrapper will be generated.**
