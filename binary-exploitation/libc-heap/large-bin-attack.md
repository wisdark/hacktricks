## Basic Information

For more information about what is a large bin check this page:

{% content-ref url="bins-and-memory-allocations.md" %}
[bins-and-memory-allocations.md](bins-and-memory-allocations.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

It's possible to find a great example in [**how2heap - large bin attack**](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc\_2.35/large\_bin\_attack.c).

Basically here you can see how, in the latest "current" version of glibc (2.35), it's not checked: **`P->bk_nextsize`** allowing to modify an arbitrary address with the value of a large bin chunk if certain conditions are met.

In that example you can find the following conditions:

* A large chunk is allocated
* A large chunk smaller than the first one but in the same index is allocated
  * Must be smalled so in the bin it must go first
* (A chunk to prevent merging with the top chunk is created)
* Then, the first large chunk is freed and a new chunk bigger than it is allocated -> Chunk1 goes to the large bin
* Then, the second large chunk is freed
* Now, the vulnerability: The attacker can modify `chunk1->bk_nextsize` to `[target-0x20]`
* Then, a larger chunk than chunk 2 is allocated, so chunk2 is inserted in the large bin overwriting the address `chunk1->bk_nextsize->fd_nextsize` with the address of  chunk2

{% hint style="success" %}
There are other potential scenarios, the thing is to add to the large bin a chunk that is **smaller** than a current X chunk in the bin, so it need to be inserted just before it in the bin, and we need to be able to modify X's **`bk_nextsize`** as thats where the address of the smaller chunk will be written to.
{% endhint %}

This is the relevant code from malloc. Comments have been added to understand better how the address was overwritten:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```c
/* if smaller than smallest, bypass loop below */
assert (chunk_main_arena (bck->bk));
if ((unsigned long) (size) < (unsigned long) chunksize_nomask (bck->bk))
  {
    fwd = bck; // fwd = p1
    bck = bck->bk; // bck = p1->bk 

    victim->fd_nextsize = fwd->fd; // p2->fd_nextsize = p1->fd (Note that p1->fd is p1 as it's the only chunk)
    victim->bk_nextsize = fwd->fd->bk_nextsize; // p2->bk_nextsize = p1->fd->bk_nextsize
    fwd->fd->bk_nextsize = victim->bk_nextsize->fd_nextsize = victim; // p1->fd->bk_nextsize->fd_nextsize = p2
  }
```
{% endcode %}

This could be used to **overwrite the `global_max_fast` global variable** of libc to then exploit a fast bin attack with larger chunks.

You can find another great explanation of this attack in [**guyinatuxedo**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/32-largebin\_attack/largebin\_explanation0/index.html).
