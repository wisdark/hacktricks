## **Malloc Hook**

As you can [Official GNU site](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html\_node/Hooks-for-Malloc.html), the variable **`__malloc_hook`** is a pointer pointing to the **address of a function that will be called** whenever `malloc()` is called **stored in the data section of the libc library**. Therefore, if this address is overwritten with a **One Gadget** for example and `malloc` is called, the **One Gadget will be called**.

To call malloc it's possible to wait for the program to call it or by **calling `printf("%10000$c")`** which allocates too bytes many making `libc`  calling malloc to allocate them in the heap.

More info about One Gadget in:

{% content-ref url="../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/one-gadget.md" %}
[one-gadget.md](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/one-gadget.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that hooks are **disabled for GLIBC >= 2.34**. There are other techniques that can be used on modern GLIBC versions. See: [https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md).
{% endhint %}

## Free Hook

This was abused in one of the example from the page abusing a fast bin attack after having abused an unsorted bin attack:

{% content-ref url="../libc-heap/unsorted-bin-attack.md" %}
[unsorted-bin-attack.md](../libc-heap/unsorted-bin-attack.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

It's posisble to find the address of `__free_hook` if the binary has symbols with the following command:

```bash
gef‚û§  p &__free_hook
```

[In the post](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/41-house\_of\_force/bkp16\_cookbook/index.html) you can find a step by step guide on how to locate the address of the free hook without symbols. As summary, in the free function:

<pre class="language-armasm"><code class="lang-armasm">gef‚û§  x/20i free
0xf75dedc0 &#x3C;free>: push   ebx
0xf75dedc1 &#x3C;free+1>: call   0xf768f625
0xf75dedc6 &#x3C;free+6>: add    ebx,0x14323a
0xf75dedcc &#x3C;free+12>:  sub    esp,0x8
0xf75dedcf &#x3C;free+15>:  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebx-0x98]
0xf75dedd5 &#x3C;free+21>:  mov    ecx,DWORD PTR [esp+0x10]
<strong>0xf75dedd9 &#x3C;free+25>:  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [eax]--- BREAK HERE
</strong>0xf75deddb &#x3C;free+27>:  test   eax,eax ;&#x3C;
0xf75deddd &#x3C;free+29>:  jne    0xf75dee50 &#x3C;free+144>
</code></pre>

In the mentioned break in the previous code in `$eax` will be located the address of the free hook.

Now a **fast bin attack** is performed:

* First of all it's discovered that it's possible to work with fast **chunks of size 200** in the **`__free_hook`** location:
* <pre class="language-c"><code class="lang-c">gef‚û§  p &#x26;__free_hook
  $1 = (void (**)(void *, const void *)) 0x7ff1e9e607a8 &#x3C;__free_hook>
  gef‚û§  x/60gx 0x7ff1e9e607a8 - 0x59
  <strong>0x7ff1e9e6074f: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000200
  </strong>0x7ff1e9e6075f: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
  0x7ff1e9e6076f &#x3C;list_all_lock+15>:      0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
  0x7ff1e9e6077f &#x3C;_IO_stdfile_2_lock+15>: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
  </code></pre>
  * If we manage to get a fast chunk of size 0x200 in this location, it'll be possible to overwrite a function pointer that will be executed
* For this, a new chunk of size `0xfc` is created and the merged function is called with that pointer twice, this way we obtain a pointer to a freed chunk of size `0xfc*2 = 0x1f8` in the fast bin.
* Then, the edit function is called in this chunk to modify the **`fd`** address of this fast bin to point to the previous **`__free_hook`** function.
* Then, a chunk with size `0x1f8` is created to retrieve from the fast bin the previous useless chunk so another chunk of size `0x1f8` is created to get a fast bin chunk in the **`__free_hook`** which is overwritten with the address of **`system`** function.
* And finally a chunk containing the string `/bin/sh\x00` is freed calling the delete function, triggering the **`__free_hook`** function which points to system with `/bin/sh\x00` as parameter.
